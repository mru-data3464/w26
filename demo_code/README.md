# Demo code written for/during lectures
I recommend using Python [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to manage your Python projects. This helps to make things reproducible by providing an isolated sandbox to work in and ensuring consistent versions.

I am using **Python 3.12** for these demos. Yes, this is not the most up-to-date version, but it is the version used by Google Colab (as of Fall 2025).

1. Run `python3.12 -m venv venv` to create the directory `venv`
2. Run `venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows) or `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) to activate your virtual environment
3. Ryn `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages used in the demo code

The requirements file may be updated through the semester as packages are added.

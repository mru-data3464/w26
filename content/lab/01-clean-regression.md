# Lab 01: Regression with Clean Data
Due date: January 19, 2026 (next lab session)

## Objective
The main goal of this exercise is for me to learn about your current habits and knowledge. It also serves as an example for why we need "clean" and easy to manage data.

## Deliverables
[Click here](#) to join the GitHub classroom and clone the "starter code". There's not much in here other than the data sets, so you'll need to add:
- Your code to load, process, and visualize the data
- A 1-page report in PDF format describing your process and answering a few questions (marked with :memo:)
- A list of references, such as:
    - Complete URLs, e.g. to library documentation or Stack Overflow answers
    - Search queries, particularly if you used the "AI overview" response
    - A complete transcript of AI chat history, if any

## Instructions
1. In the programming language of your choice, write a program to:
    1. Load the data in `simple_regression.csv`
    2. Calculate the line of best fit using simple linear regression
    3. Create a scatter plot of the data with the best fit line

    > :memo: Don't forget to document your process as you do this!

2. :memo: Copy

    1. Load the data in `missing_values.csv`
